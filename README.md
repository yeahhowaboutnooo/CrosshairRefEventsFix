# CrosshairRefEventsFix

Fixes the bug that continual CrosshairRef Events are being sent to the
registered Papyrus scripts when the activate/use key is disabled via
DisablePlayerControls. Which would normally result in an overloaded script
engine.

supports SSE and SAE

basically any C++ editor, e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
[CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) or [Visual

automatically run CMake!
